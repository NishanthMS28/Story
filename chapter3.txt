I am here to say that by the end of my college life I would be atleast able to make 10lakh/annum through freelancing. This is actually less what I am saying, I am keeping 
it less because I don't have much idea in this feild as of now so I can't predict, but yeah I want reach an extent that it actually matches whatever package that I recieve
from the college.
